# What is this?

This repository is a template for anybody who wants to have a HTTP client straight in the terminal. 

I have found through [this article](https://golangexample.com/an-http-api-client-for-the-terminal/) amd figured, I could create something that would make it easier to adopt.

### Requirements:

* [brew](https://brew.sh)
  * I use it on Linux as well as on macOS

If you don't want to install brew, have a look to [ain's github page](https://github.com/jonaslu/ain)


If you are planning to use my repository, I **strongly recommend** that you use it privately, **especially** if you are planning to use it as your everyday tool on production infrastructure.
